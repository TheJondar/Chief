      <p>Your access to and use of the Service is also conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with the
        Privacy
        Policy of the Company. Our Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and
        disclosure
        of Your personal information when You use the Application or the Website and tells You about Your privacy
        rights and
        how the law protects You. Please read Our Privacy Policy carefully before using Our Service.</p>
      <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
      <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by
        the Company.
      </p>
      <p>The Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
        practices of
        any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be
        responsible or
        liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection
        with the use
        of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or
        services.</p>
      <p>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites
        or services
        that You visit.</p>
      <h4>Termination</h4>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
        whatsoever,
        including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
      <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
        suppliers under
        any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
        amount actually
        paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
        liable for any
        special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages
        for loss of
        profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
        privacy arising
        out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or
        third-party
        hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the
        Company or
        any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
        essential
        purpose.</p>
      <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
        consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
        party's
        liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
      <h4>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h4>
      <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and
        defects without
        warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf
        and on
        behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
        all
        warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all
        implied
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and
        warranties that may
        arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
        foregoing,
        the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service
        will meet
        Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
        applications, systems
        or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free
        or that any
        errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
      <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
        representation or
        warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
        information,
        content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
        error-free; (iii)
        as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service;
        or (iv) that
        the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of
        viruses, scripts,
        trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
        statutory
        rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in
        such a case
        the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
        enforceable under
        applicable law.</p>
      <h4>Governing Law</h4>
      <p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of
        the Service.
        Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.
      </p>
      <h4>Disputes Resolution</h4>
      <p>If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute
        informally by
        contacting the Company.</p>
      <h4>For European Union (EU) Users</h4>
      <p>If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the
        country in
        which you are resident in.</p>
      <h4>United States Legal Compliance</h4>
      <p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
        government
        embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist supporting&quot;
        country,
        and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
      <h4>Severability and Waiver</h4>
      <h4>Severability</h4>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed
        and
        interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
        applicable law and
        the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
      <h4>Waiver</h4>
      <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation
        under these
        Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
        thereafter nor
        shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
      <h4>Translation Interpretation</h4>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
        You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
      <h4>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h4>
      <p>We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision
        is material
        We will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
        What
        constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole discretion.</p>
      <p>By continuing to access or use Our Service after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound
        by the
        revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the website
        and the
        Service.</p>
